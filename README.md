# OpSysProject3

File System Project
This project was completed by Logan Leone and Aaron Cohen, we had a third person in our group but he ended up switching groups and we coudn't get anyone else to join.
File Listing:
file_system.c
makefile
README.md

Makefile description:
Makefile compiles the file_system.c into file_system.x which you can run
We mount the image in our file with the name "fat32.img" so the fat image needs to be named that and it needs to have Read and write permissions.

Logan worked on:
Exit
Size
ls
cd
creat
mkdir
open
close

Aaron worked on:
info
read
write
rm
cp
